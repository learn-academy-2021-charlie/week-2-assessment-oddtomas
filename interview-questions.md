# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: An iteration is the process of repeating code until a specified condition is met. This process can be seen with the concept of loops in programming where the loop will start at a set point, run until the set parameters are met such as the length of an array, or while "i" is less than a certain number, and it will perform an action like increase, decrease, or whatever you want each iteration.

2. The built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() takes three predefined parameters which are value, index, and array. Only one is required and it can be any of them depending on what you want out of the .map function.

3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is when you essentially assign the object to a variable so that the objects attributes can be accessed from outside of the object easier.

4. What is the difference between an object and a class?

  Your answer: The difference between an object and a class is that the class is the blueprint for objects. The class lays a foundation for you to call upon to create different objects. The class sort of acts similarly to how functions can take in parameters to produce different outputs depending on what arguments are passed to it. Depending on what you pass to the class' constructor you will get a different object output each time. The object itself is a essentially another sort of container of information. Classes can be larely customizable to be unique and specific to something, such as a car class having specific methods or attributes that make sense to a car.

5. Why would you use the method super()?

  Your answer: You would use the method super() when you are dealing with inheritance and a child class. The super method allows a child class to inherit the attributes of the parent class it is inheriting from. For example if the orignal/generic/parent class has attributes like this.color, when making a child class by putting super() inside of the constructor now gives the child class the attribute of this.color.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I have no idea, perhaps it has something to do with pulling stuff in; literally hoisting.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. React: React is a js library used for building small component or a piece of the user interface and combining it all together to make complex websites, apps, etc. React helps us essentially make a tree of components to make one complete product. 

2. React lifecycle methods: These methods describe the stages that a component goes through in its life cycle. The phases of a react component are mounting, updating, and unmounting. There are methods that help the component work throguh each cycle. 

3. React state: In react state is an object that stores the property values that belong to a react component. The react component "reacts" to changes in the state.

4. Component invocation/call: Calling in react functions similarly to calling a function. In react you can call components from other components like from a child component to the main component because react is like a big tree of components stemming from eachother. 

5. DOM Events:
